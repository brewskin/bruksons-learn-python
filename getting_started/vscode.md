# Installing VSCode on Windows

Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and download the appropriate VSCode version. Use the system installer for simplicity.

## Add Extenstions

Navigate to the Extensions tab on the left and download the `Python` extension. This should appear as the most popular extension.

## Create a workspace

File -> Save Workspace As and save the workspace in the git directory of your project with the same name.

## Useful Settings

On windows use CTRL + comman[,] to open the settings menu. On the side panel go to `Text Editor` -> `Formatting` and enable `Format on Save`. 
This is useful because it will automatically format the text in an appropriate and consistent way. This is useful for code readability and consistent structure.

Then, `Text Editor` -> `Files` and endable `Auto Save` with `onFocusChange`. Sometimes you forget to save a file and it sucks. This will save the file anytime you click somewhere outside of the text area.
